#ArduPilot 3.4 Dev - ArduCopter with Added Precision Landing RTL Flight Mode#
This codebase is a copy of the ArduPilot 3.4 Dev code (As of 1/14/2016) but with IRLock Precision Landing enabled in both LAND and a new RTL Precision flight modes.

The original RTL flight mode is unmodified. To use the new flight mode, you will need to set one of your flight mode parameters to "18". You can do this in the Mission Planner full parameters list, but this will not show up under Mission Planner's list of Flight Modes.
